A study of what determines the price of used cars on sale in the german website [autoscout24.de](https://www.autoscout24.de/).

1. scrape the autoscout24.de webpages to extract car data for different german cities, car brands and body types; it uses the python library BeautifulSoup.
2. train a series of machine learning models to predict car prices and study the relative importance of different car features to the final price.
